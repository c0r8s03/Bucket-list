  <h1 id="rcorners9">Childhood Dream  - Lake Baikal</h1>
   <p>Lake Baikal, the world’s oldest and deepest freshwater lake, curves for nearly 400 miles through south-eastern Siberia, north of the Mongolian border.
       It lies in a cleft where Asia is literally splitting apart, the beginnings of a future ocean.
       Geologists say Baikal today shows what the seaboards of North America, Africa and Europe looked like as 
       they began to separate millions of years ago.
       More than 5,000 feet deep (1637m) at its most profound, with another four-mile-thick layer
       of sediment further down, the lake’s cold, oxygen-rich waters teem with bizarre life-forms.
       Surrounded by mile-high snowcapped mountains, Lake Baikal still offers vistas of unmatched beauty.
       The mountains are still a haven for wild animals, and the small villages are still outposts 
       of tranquillity and self-reliance in the remote Siberian taiga, as the forest is called.

            <h1 id="rcorners8">Geography</h1>
            
            <h5 class="text">  Situated in south-east Siberia, the 3.15-million-ha Lake Baikal is the oldest (25 million years) and deepest (1,700 m) lake in the world.
It contains 20% of the world's total unfrozen freshwater reserve. Geologists estimate that Lake Baikal formed somewhere 20-25 million years ago, during the Mesozoic.
Into Lake Baikal flow more than 330 rivers and streams, the largest of which include the Selenga, Barguzin,
Upper (Verkhnyaya) Angara, Chikoy, and Uda. The lake hollow is not symmetrical, having steep slopes on the western shores and gentler slopes on the eastern. The meandering shoreline runs for some 1,300 miles (2,100 km), with large indentations at the bays of Barguzin, Chivyrkuysky, and Proval and at Ayaya and Frolikha inlets; the Svyatoy Nos Peninsula juts out into the lake from the eastern shore. Baikal contains some 45 islets and islands,
the largest of which are Olkhon (about 270 square miles [700 square km]) and Bolshoy (Great) Ushkany (3.6 square miles [9.4 square km]). The influx of water into the lake is primarily from rivers, chiefly the Selenga. 
The only outflow is through the Angara River, a tributary of the Yenisey.</h5> 
            
             <h1 id="rcorners8">Weather</h1>
            
         <h5>  Baikal’s climate is much milder than that of the surrounding territory. Winter air temperatures average −6 °F (−21 °C), and August temperatures average 52 °F (11 °C).
The lake surface freezes in January and thaws in May or June. The water temperature at the surface in August is between 50 and 54 °F (10 and 12 °C) and reaches 68 °F (20 °C)
in the offshore shallows. Waves can be as high as 15 feet (4.6 metres). </h5> 

   
             <h1 id="rcorners8">Flora and Fauna</h1>
            
         <h5>  The extent of biodiversity present in Lake Baikal surpasses all except a few lakes.
         Lake Baikal hosts 1,085 species of plants and 1,550 species and varieties of animals, with over 80 percent of animals endemic.
         Known as the 'Galapagos of Russia', its age and isolation have produced one of the world's richest and most unusual freshwater 
faunas, which is of exceptional value to evolutionary science. Plant and animal life in the lake is rich and various. 
There are some 50 species of fish, belonging to seven families; the most numerous of these are the 25 species of gobies. 
The omul salmon is heavily fished; also important are the grayling, lake whitefish, and sturgeon. 
Unique to the lake is a fish called the golomyanka, of the family Comephoridae, which gives birth to live young. 
The one mammal species is the Baikal seal, or <b class="icon1" title="Baikal Seal lives only in freshwater" rel="popover" data-content=""> nerpa </b> (Phoca sibirica).<br>
There are more than 320 bird species in the Baikal area. <br></h5> 


             <h1 id="rcorners8">History</h1>
            
         <h5>  Lots of people had been living near Baikal since ancient times when more than three centuries ago,first mention of its name appeared in
Chinese writings in 110 year B.C. as "Beihai" (Northern Sea). Since then several cultures have been changing on its shores when in the XVIII century Buryat nationality came 
into being.The Russian sources first mention Baikal in 1640. The further centuries are the time of exploration and description by Russian Cossacks and the 
Church till first scientific expedition in 1723. On 13, October, 1905 the Circum-Baikal Railway is opened. In 1916 Barguzinsky Nature Reserve is organized.
the first Russian explorers drew near the lake.Having been explored for three centuries, Baikal still keeps many mysteries. 


</h5> 

 <h1 id="rcorners8">Legends and Culture</h1>
            
         <h5>  It plays a momentous role in Mongol history. The Secret History of The Mongols relates, 
         through its ancestral myth, how the Mongol people came into being: The blue-gray wolf and his wife, the reddish-brown deer, 
         came from Northern Siberia with its vast Tundra and 
         Taiga areas and travelled together across the "inland sea" - that is the Bajkal Sea. 
         Baikal also has enormous cultural significance for people of several faiths, 
including Buddhism and Shamanism, who live around its shores.This remarkable lake is a one of Asia’s holy places. 
Peoples through over the centuries prayed to the lake and believed in its power. 
You can still see at the lake the unique carvings and parts of the ritual buildings of the tribes that gone thousands years ago.
Baikal was added to the World Heritage list by UNESCO in 1996.</h5>

not only up-to-date tourist attractions, but to create an accompanying transport [network]
and far-reaching logistical infrastructure [around the lake]
to attract a significant number of tourists to the region.”

<h5> <b class="icon" rel="popover"  data-trigger="hover" data-content="" title="Baikal Delicacy">The omul</b> (Coregonus migratorius) also known as « Baikal omul »
is a whitefish species of the salmon family endemic to Lake Baikal in Siberia.
It is considered a food delicacy and it can be eaten in many ways: for example, smoked omul is sold around the lake and is one of the « food treasures » for many travelers on the Trans-siberian railway. It is used in a dish called « saguaday », a sort of salad made of raw omul with salt, pepper and oil ; 
or cooked on a stick: the freshly caught fish is washed, salted and pierced with a wooden stick along its ridge. The sticks with omul fish are roasted, then served with scallions or rice. « Stroganina » 
is another Siberian salad and it consists in uncooked frozen omul cut finely and served with pepper, salt and onion.<br>
