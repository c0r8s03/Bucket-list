  <h1 id="rcorners9">Treetop Hotels</h1>
   <p>Tree house hotels are a fast-growing trend that allows anyone to escape the mundane with a new perspective on nature.

Not only are tree house hotels praised for their novel design, but they also have a sustainable edge on traditional hotels. Building tree houses requires no clearing of the ground around the grove, and hotel owners (and visitors) have a stake in the health of the tree that supports the lodging. This, along with visitors’ close proximity 
to nature during their temporary residence, leads to a unique way for them to connect with the natural world around them. 
Nothing beats sleeping in the open air wonder of the jungle, waking up an taking a dip under a water fall.

         <h5>  Tucked away within a thriving jungle paradise on its own private 3 acres are our new Treehaus Hideaway Villas.
               The unique aloneness of the contemporary structures sets the tone for an unforgettable romantic interlude in one of Costa Rica's
               most dramatic settings.<br>
                Perched on a platform 20 feet above the ground and amongst the treetops, the treehaus hideaways offer seclusion,

                A suspended ramp or sweeping staircase surrounded by trees and flowers - leads you to 
                a wraparound deck offering wide views of the ocean below and rainforest covered mountains all around.

             <h1 id="rcorners8">Out’n’About Treehouse Treesort</h1>
            
         <h5>  There’s a commonality at the Out'n'About Treehouse Treesort that creates fast friends among
         the nightly tenants of its twelve world-class tree houses: All guests have waited for this night for upward of a
         year—the furthest advance booking allowed. Each tree house is unique and sparingly decorated with a rustic, camping feel
         , and the Treesort is modeled as a bed and breakfast with the events and scope of a resort. With plenty of activities to fill the day, from horseback riding to an extensive zip-line course, you’ll 
         want to make sure to carve some time out to marvel at the structures suspended in the trees or sit back in your high 
         post and take in the view. <br>
         Out'n'About is a truly unique place. Part of it's uniqueness has to do with that is a home grown and based business. There are no locks on the treehouse doors. It is not a Ramada Inn or Hilton in the trees, but is a genuine four star Treesort right next to Siskiyou National Forest land & old growth wilderness. Very family oriented! And friendly, you 
         can find everything from a calm peaceful solitude, or gentle ride on a horse, to a screaming run on the Ziplines or giant Tarzan Swing.</h5> 


             <h1 id="rcorners8">Sarinbuana Eco Lodge</h1>
            
         <h5>  Sarinbuana Eco Lodge is a haven for Nature lovers...
A perfect  escape from a busy life to recharge & get back to Nature ... 
Nestled in an untapped valley that tumbles of Mount Batukaru is a playground for those who relish in the overused mantras of the intrepid traveller; 
off the beaten track where jungle lovers can blaze their own path, roam wild and free and seek adventure. Taste Traditional Balinese flavours - sourced from our Organic gardens. 
Sleep well with the gentle sounds of Nature...
Breathe in clean mountain air & bathe in our mountain spring water pools...  
Spend time with our local community & explore the rainforest,
Rice paddies & traditional farmlands.
The term “eco-retreat” gets thrown around pretty casually now that it’s synonymous with chic tree houses and kimono photoshoots. But Sarinbuana goes over and above the reminder to reuse your towel sign and a couple of organic soaps.

There are no TVs, no air-conditioning units and no insect coils or repellants. If you’re afraid of an 8-legged critter in your room or bothered by a trail of insects, they will be safely relocated back into the garden. As the guest book educates, spiders are for eating mosquitoes, geckos are for scaring off mice and ants are for breaking down compost. The magic of the valley is left to its own devices with the knowledge that everything has a purpose.

Guests can also choose to ramp up the environmental consciousness of their stay by picking the “eco-meals” on the menu. For lunch, this might mean a salad of shredded coconut, Lombok chili and wild harvested fiddlehead fern tips; for dinner, this could be young coconut soup and a Sumatran curry followed by raw chocolate mousse. No one said eating environmentally had to mean compromise.

 <h1 id="rcorners8">Lost Meadow Treepod - Treehouse in Cornwall, United Kingdom</h1>
            
         <h5>  The surreal-looking Lost Meadow Treepod
         is a cedar-clad ball suspended between two trees in a north Cornish woodland. Accessible via a staircase,
         the pod contains a cosy bedroom with a woodburner. A kitchen hut, and fire circle, can be found just below. Nearby is 
         a small river (complete with stepping stones) and a meadow for games and picnics.
         It’s spherical, it’s sustainable and it’s suspended from strong cables 3m above the ground, with a ceiling window to watch the stars at night. Scale a sturdy wooden staircase to reach your
         bedroom in the trees, with owls for company. Clad in cedar shingles (an upgrade from its previous incarnation as a canvas 'tree tent'), the lightweight structure was ingeniously built both to minimise impact on the trees and to withstand unimaginable weights, with design inspiration taken from early zeppelin engineering, so both you and the woodland are in safe hands! The wood burner makes it suitable for stays year round. 
When the sun's out, open up the double-glazed window to give panoramic views through the trees and down over the river - you have 20 acres to roam
and explore shared only with the Warleggan Wagon guests (or some of your friends if you book the two together!) - and for even more open air relaxation, take a nap in the hammock in your ground-level camp – if you’re really quiet, you might get to see a kingfisher diving over the water. In fact, although it’s very impressive, the treepod itself is only the start of your woodland adventure. 
running through your woodland camp is a babbling river complete with stepping stones. Below the tent is a kitchen hut, a fire circle, and there’s even a riverside living ‘room’ in an afternoon suntrap 20 m away.
As if a hanging globe for a bedroom, a river to fish in and 20 acres of woodland weren't enough, you're in a great place to sample all that North Cornwall has to offer. Go looking for the beast of Bodmin, or head down to the sea - you're just a half hour drive from the coast and the sandy beaches at Looe.</h5> 

<h1 id="rcorners8">Chole Mjini, Tanzania</h1>
    


<h5>Chole Mjini is an eco-friendly treehouse lodge on a tiny island, near a small island called Mafia about 60 miles south of Zanzibar (Tanzania). 
There are 6 treehouse rooms built on stilts around baobab trees. The rooms are simple but comfortable and overlook the gorgeous blue Indian Ocean. 
They're furnished with 4 poster beds, a private bathroom (on level ground) and all romantically lit with oil lamps.
Chole Mjini is one of the most original small lodges that we know in East Africa. It stands on Chole Island, just off the coast of Mafia Island, which is a peaceful and charming hideaway in an area that sees little tourism.The lodge was built to be environmentally sound, and to give real benefits to the local community.
Built among 19th century ruins, it's all quite Indiana Jones: the ultimate eco-lodge, built before the term became so commonplace.
Food is freshly prepared daily (there are no fridges on the island) and should fill you up enough to spend an idyllic day snorkeling or diving. You can take dhow trips, watch turtles hatch and visit the local community that you help support by staying here.
