  <h1 id="rcorners9">Iceland</h1>
   <p>The name itself conjures up an image of a land of imposing ice formations,
   and while that isn’t too far off, Iceland is more than just arctic temps and shining glaciers. 
   Don’t let the cold deter you: Iceland might be almost at the top of the world, just below the Arctic Circle, but its winter temperatures are often warmer than those in New York (and it's only a 5-hour plane ride from New York, too).

While its dramatic, otherworldly natural wonders, especially the northern lights, are nothing short of magical, there are many more reasons you’ll be enchanted on a visit to Iceland.

            <h1 id="rcorners8">Geography</h1>
            
            <h5 class="text">  Iceland is an island in the Atlantic Ocean, located near the Arctic Circle, between Greenland and Norway. 
            An island of 103.000 km2 (40,000 square miles), it is about the same size as Hungary and Portugal, or Kentucky and Virginia.
            Iceland is the second largest island in Europe, following Great Britain, and the 18th largest island in the world. The coastline is 4,970 km, and Iceland maintains a 200 nautical-miles exclusive economic zone. 
            It takes approximately five hours to fly from New York to Reykjavík, and three hours from London.Iceland is the least populated country in Europe. Almost 80% of the country is uninhabited, and much of its terrain consists of plateaux, mountain peaks, and fertile lowlands. There are many long, deep fjords and glaciers, including Europe’s largest, Vatnajökull.
            Its landscape’s is characterized by waterfalls, geysers, volcanoes, black sand beaches and otherworldly steaming lava fields. Iceland is covered by ice, glaciers and geysers and has got more than 20 active volcanoes.
            Grimsvoetn and Hekla are Iceland's most active volcanoes. 
            In 2010, the latest major eruption of on of the island's glaciers took place on the Eyjafjallajokull.</h5> 
            
             <h1 id="rcorners8">Weather</h1>
            
         <h5>  Iceland has very mild, coastal weather, stemming from the Gulf Stream. The weather is also affected by the East Greenland polar current curving south-eastwards round the north and east coasts. The average summer temperature in Reykjavik is 10.6°C/51°F in July, with average highs of 24.3°C/76°F. The average winter temperature
         in Reykjavik is similar to New York City's, about 0°C/32°F in January (average highs are 9.9°C/50°C). The weather can be very unpredictable and often changes in an instant. </h5> 

   
             <h1 id="rcorners8">Flora and Fauna</h1>
            
         <h5>  Although there are a few small trees (ash, aspen, birch, and willow), 
         the chief forms of vegetation are grass, mosses, and small shrubs (heather, willow, dwarf birch). 
         Some 340 different species of flowers have been listed, but most of these are sparse.

The fox, the chief indigenous animal, is common. 
Wild reindeer, introduced in the 18th century and once abundant, were almost exterminated and therefore have been protected in recent years; they are found chiefly in the northeastern highlands. The waters around Iceland abound in whales, many types of seals, and many kinds of fish. Dolphin, grampus, porpoise, and rorqual are numerous. Cod, haddock, and herring are particularly abundant, but there are also sole, shark, halibut, redfish, saithe, and other fish. Salmon abound in many rivers and trout in rivers and lakes. There are about 88 species of breeding birds; most are aquatic. The chief resident birds are eiderduck (raised commercially for their down) and ptarmigan. Other characteristic indigenous birds are swan, eagle, falcon, and gannet, all rare now and protected. Iceland has no reptiles or frogs and very little insect life.



</h5> 


             <h1 id="rcorners8">History</h1>
            
         <h5>  The first people to settle in Iceland were probably Irish monks who came in the 8th century. 
         The earliest inhabitants of Iceland were Irish hermits, who left the island upon the arrival of the pagan Norse people in the late 9th century.However in the 9th century they were driven out by Vikings.

According to tradition the first Viking to discover Iceland was a man named Naddoddur who got lost while on his way to the Faeroes. 
First Viking attempt to settle was by a Norwegian named Floki Vilgeroason. 
He landed in the northwest but a severe winter killed his domestic animals and he sailed back to Norway. 
However he gave the land its name. He called it Iceland.  A constitution drawn up c. 930 created a form of democracy and provided for an Althing, the world's oldest practicing legislative assembly. The island's early history was preserved in the Icelandic sagas of the 13th century.

In 1262–1264, Iceland came under Norwegian rule and passed to ultimate Danish control through the unification of the kingdoms of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (the Kalmar Union) in 1397.

In 1874, Icelanders obtained their own constitution, and in 1918, Denmark recognized Iceland, via the Act of Union, as a separate state with unlimited sovereignty. It remained, however, nominally under the Danish monarchy.

During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, British, then American, troops occupied Iceland and used it for a strategic air base. While officially neutral, 
Iceland cooperated with the Allies throughout the conflict. On June 17, 1944, after a popular referendum, the Althing proclaimed Iceland an independent republic. 



</h5> 

 <h1 id="rcorners8">Legends and Culture</h1>
            
         <h5>  Iceland has a mythical history like no other place, filled with stories of elves, trolls, vikings, ghosts, and fortune tellers.
         Belief in huldufólk - hidden people or elves - is fairly common, 
         to such an extent that roadwork projects that run into trouble are sometimes said to be angering
         local elves and a medium must be consulted before work can continue.  Situated just off the coast near the southern town of Vík are the volcanic sea stacks known as Reynisdrangar. 
         According to the Icelandic legend, these stacks were formed when three mischievous trolls attempted to pull a ship ashore,
         but ended up getting caught by the light of dawn and became frozen in time. </h5> 

<h1 id="rcorners8">Tourism</h1>
    


<h5>Once, Iceland’s top industry was fishing. Now, tourism drives economic growth in Iceland. 
Here you'll discover active volcanoes, geysers, hot springs, glaciers, ice fields, and fjords, for this sparsely populated country,
resting at the edge of the Arctic Circle, sits atop one of the world's most volcanically active areas.
More than 2.2 million tourists—roughly six times the country’s population—are expected 
to visit Iceland this year for the rugged beauty, glaciers, volcanoes, 
Northern Lights, and perhaps surprisingly, agriculture. “Agritourists” are people who travel to enjoy local 
food and a taste of the agrarian lifestyle, and even on this isolated Arctic island, agritourism is taking off. “

<h1 id="rcorners8">Local Delicacy</h1>
    


<!--<h5>The <span style="font-weight:bold"> omul </span>(Coregonus migratorius) also known as « Baikal omul »-->

<h5> Considering how isolated Iceland has been for most of its history, it´s no wonder the island´s tiny population (320,000!) has developed a unique cuisine based on whatever raw materials
were available. Many traditional ingredients and dishes remain popular to this day and you would be crazy not to try these delicious delicacies when you go.
Rotted shark, breast of puffin, sheep's head, ram's testicles, skyr (a cultured milk preparation served as dessert), blood pudding ... Iceland's traditional foods are not for those of a sensitive disposition or delicate stomach. <br>
